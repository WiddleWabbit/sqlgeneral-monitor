# The SYSTEM section is REQUIRED.
# System houses the configuration for databases and values for what queries to track
#
# The databases that are to be recorded is REQUIRED to be included in the configuration
# They must be specified in a comma separated format without quotes under databases
#
#       Example:
#       databases = database1, database2
#
# The sql commands to be recorded are also REQUIRED
# They should be specified under record in a comma separated list without quotes.
# *Currently due to implementation method only supports single words - Things like START TRANSACTION will not work
#
#       Example:
#       record = INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, CREATE, DROP, FLUSH, HASH, REHASH, ALTER, START, COMMIT, ROLLBACK
#
# The export folder is also REQUIRED
# It should be specified as an absolute path under export
#
#       Example:
#       export = /root/scripts/working/export/
#
#       Example of System Configuration:
#       [SYSTEM]
#       databases = site_database, database_2
#       record = DELETE, DROP, FLUSH, START, COMMIT
#       export = /root/scripts/working/export/

[SYSTEM]
databases = database1, database2, database3
record = INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, CREATE, DROP, FLUSH, HASH, REHASH, ALTER, START, COMMIT, ROLLBACK
export = /root/exports/

# Each database listed is REQUIRED to have a section for it listed below
# Each database section should be specifed with its name exactly the same as it was specified
# in the system section of the configuration file
#
#       Example:
#       [database1]
#
# Each database section should contain the user field to specifiy a user to associate with
# the database.
#
#       Example:
#       user = exampleuser
#
# Each database has the option to filter its output file of empty start transactions and either rollbacks or commits
# The value is just a boolean, 1 or 0
#
#       Example:
#       filter_output = 1
#
# The ignore tables field can also be specified to mark the tables that should not be saved for
# a particular database. This should be specified in a comma separated list without quotes
# If there are no tables to be ignored just leave it blank
#
#       Example:
#       ignore_tables = table1, table2, table3
#
#       Example Database Configuration:
#       [site_database]
#       user = website_user
#       ignore_tables = cron_schedule, cron_exec
#
